###MY CV
Toms ELvijs Å usts
Tel.+371 26460940  Mail: tomselvijs@gmail.com
I have graduated from my masters programme in Chemistry and thus far most of my experiance comes from working in the scientific field.
Going forward I would like to hone the scripting abilities, that I have gained thus far. 
My background in science should signify that I posses an analytical mind and that I like to learn. Aside from that I also do learn fast if set in the right tracks.
Code examples (N/A)
My experiance comes entirely from the academic field, where I wrote small scripts in Wolphram mathematica to apply thereticaal models to experimental data or working with the CERN Grid system. 
For my scripting needs I have done some basic self-learning for python, wolfram mathematica, C++, JavaScript and SQL languages. 
I am proficient in the english language, scoring a C1 in the test provided by RS school. I have also spent a semester abroad in Greece, where I had to rely on my english skills.
